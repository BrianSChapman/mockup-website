# The StoweAway (Mock Up Website)

## Description

As a lover of all thing tiki, a passion for speakeasy bars, and a newfound interest in the beauty of Vermont, I had an idea - what if Stowe, VT had a tiki bar/speak easy concept called... The StoweAway. 

This website is a general layout and a clone of tiki bar websites that have inspired me: Smuggler's Cove (San Francisco, CA) and Hala Pele (Portland, OR) in particular.
